              <!-- use the <p> to display a famous quote from your hero -->
              <p> "And I think that it doesn't matter if you're a woman or a man. When somebody is really true in that, and they're doing something powerful, I don't think anybody could deny that. So, I had to start looking at it as, 'I'm a powerful woman and I'm going to create whatever it is I want, in any genre of music it is that I want, and nothing's going to stop me.'"  </p>
